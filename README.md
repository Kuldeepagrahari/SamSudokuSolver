# ðŸŒŒ Sudoku Solver

A futuristic, visually animated Sudoku solver built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project transforms the classic Sudoku solver into a stunning visual experience, featuring a "Cosmic UI" with glassmorphism, neon glows, and a step-by-step visualization of the backtracking algorithm.

### A quick look at the interface in action:


## âœ¨ Features

* **Interactive "Cosmic" UI:** A dynamic, animated background with a spotlight effect that follows your mouse cursor.
* **Glassmorphism Design:** The Sudoku grid and controls feature a modern, frosted-glass effect.
* **User-Input Driven:** Starts with a blank grid, allowing you to enter any Sudoku puzzle you want to solve.
* **Initial Board Validation:** Before solving, the application validates your input to ensure there are no duplicate numbers in any row, column, or 3x3 box.
* **Visual Backtracking Animation:** Instead of instantly displaying the solution, the solver **visually animates the backtracking algorithm**, showing you how it tries numbers, makes progress, and backtracks from dead ends.
* **Fully Responsive:** The layout is optimized for a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
